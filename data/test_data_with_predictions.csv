I understand my financial responsibility to pay for a car , but it is also their responsibility to hold up their end of the contract that i signed and not to breach it when I signed for a vehicle service contract and gap insurance . It is also unfortunate that US auto sale is the lienholder on my car . Therefore , I can not trade it or sell it . If there are some possible suggestion that could be given to me on what should be done in this matter , could you please reach out to me a soon a possible ? thank you .",Vehicle loan or lease,Vehicle loan or lease

"On XX/XX/XXXX , I discovered a notice on my door from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , alleging that I wa past due by approximately { $ 3000.00 } in rent . This notice wa perplexing , a I had not received any prior communication regarding late fee or a rent increase . I 'd like to emphasize that I consistently paid my rent , either through the apartment portal or by money order , adhering to the agreed-upon amount of { $ 810.00 } a stipulated in my lease contract . Before XXXX , I encountered some payment issue and promptly informed XXXX XXXX , whom I met in person at the office . I explained that there had been an error in my paycheck by the United States XXXX XXXX XXXX department , which might result in a delay in rent payment . XXXX kindly assured me that she would waive any late fee due to this unforeseen hardship . However , when I received the notice , I visited the office to seek clarification . XXXX presented statement indicating that we owed a differential amount based on a new rate . I requested evidence of any prior notice or letter regarding the rent increase or late fee , but she could n't provide any . According to the law , eviction notice must be written and served , which never happened in my case . My husband and I had informed the leasing office that we would be relocating due to PCS order and XXXX order , scheduled for XXXX . Furthermore , it 's important to note that a landlord can not evict a servicemember or their dependent from their primary residence without a court order , and the court ha the authority to adjust lease obligation to protect the interest of both party ( XXXX XXXX . ) . I believe that the leasing office 's action violated our right a service member and were not in compliance with the law . They also sold the debt to a third-party collection agency , despite having written it off a a charge-off , resulting in the collection agency attempting to collect the debt . This ha had a negative impact on my credit , and I request that the collection be removed and compensation for the damage incurred . Additionally , the leasing office failed to return our security deposit and did not provide an itemized list of deduction within the required 60 day , which they are now two year late in doing . I have provided documentation , including my lease , to demonstrate that no notice wa ever given regarding a rent increase or accumulating late fee due to our hardship or deployment . In summary , I am seeking resolution for these issue , including the removal of the collection , compensation for damage , and the return of our security deposit with the required itemized list of deduction . These action were taken in violation of our right a service member under the SCRA , and I believe it is essential to rectify these matter appropriately .

"On XX/XX/XXXX I completed an online request via Western Union for a { $ 30.00 } Money Transfer from XXXX , MD ( USA ) to XXXX , XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) . The total amount rendered wa { $ 33.00 } given the { $ 3.00 } fee . Upon two attempt by the verified recipient , Western Union in XXXX requested that my bank wa contacted to confirm that the payment wa cleared . On XXXX XXXX I contacted my bank . My bank found this odd where the transaction wa cleared and no fraud wa detected . On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Western Union who shared that because the money wa sent to XXXX they have additional alert due to the potential for fraud . This initial designation ( XXXX ) wa concerning , where I am aware that there is fraud in every country . The Western Union rep went on to ask me the following question to verify the transaction wa not fraudulent ( the agent noted that these are to protect this transaction from fraud ) : 1 . My name and the recipient 's name . 2 . My relationship with the recipient . ( cousin ) . 3 . Why did I send the money ? ( tutoring service ) 4.When wa the last time I saw my cousin face to face ? ( XXXX ) 5 . How wa I introduced to my cousin for the first time ? ( at birth ) 4 . Did you meet your cousin in XXXX ? ( yes ) 5 . How long have you known your cousin ? ( his entire life ) 6 . How do you communicate with your cousin ? ( internationally ) 7 . Whenever I receive voice communication do I recognize my cousin 's voice ? ( yes ) As a consumer , customer , family member , first generation American , and criminologist I found this experience horrifying , traumatizing . Again by initially acknowledging the problem is `` XXXX `` alerted me to the reality that where XXXX is a predominately XXXX country there may be exclusive check in place that should apply to every country because every country ha fraud , fraudulent Western Union transaction . Then the question in no way verify that me a the sender or my cousin a the receiver wa being protected from fraud . When the online transaction wa initially made it wa clear that Western Union had protection in place . # 1 The recipient would have to bring photo ID in order to pick up the { $ 30.00 } . # 2 Only myself and the recipient had the transaction number to verify who should pick this up . At no time during the initial transaction wa it clear that Western Union would ask me the very personal , unrelated , barrage of question . I wa offended and concerned that this is a practice the company us . All of this led to my transaction being cancelled and a refund being issued . Soon after receiving the cancellation email , Western Union sent an email stating that the transaction wa cleared and that the recipient could pick up the fund ( all confusing , misleading , and concerning ) . My cousin did not receive the money through Western Union a promised . It is clear that Western Union likely discriminates based on the demographic of a country . It is clear that a predominately XXXX nation like XXXX is targeted a highly criminal , hence there 's a gross assumption that every transaction ( including this small transaction involving { $ 30.00 } ) would lend to this disturbing series of question and assumption about the legitimacy of a transaction . As a person who train law enforcement , acknowledging systemic racism/ discrimination it is clear that Western Union need to be cited for problematic practice . I have noted that a similar complaint wa filed regarding monies sent to XXXX country that are predominately XXXX . XXXX XXXX XXXX I have experienced first hand the pain of the criminal label that led to harm - my cousin not receiving promised fund and my being traumatized by the experience , especially involving the invasive question .

I had a dispute with the insurance company , XXXX , over an inspection that wa suddenly required after I called to update my address in XXXX , after I already wa in Texas preparing to deploy .

I notified the lender of the insurance claim a well and I continued making payment every month with auto pay . Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX , and the vehicle wa recovered by local law enforcement . I wa still away , so my father wa notified and then told me to call the local impound , XXXX XXXX . where they told me either I had to fly back personally and retrieve it or release it to my insurance . Which I did not have since the car wa stolen ; the insurer later dropped me . A family friend in the insurance industry told me to make a complaint to the state and see if they can help . I did not want to risk a lien on my account . Florida investigated , then later found in my favor that an inspection wa not required and that XXXX had to honor the claim . I wa emailed this notice in XX/XX/XXXX . ( I have the email and memo ) My lender , XXXX XXXX , took payment from me in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX . I have the bank statement to show for it . They later claimed I wa delinquent and sent a threatening letter to my mailing address instead of any other form of contact despite the fact I had called and updated them that the insurance claim wa on going . According to XXXX , because the vehicle wa impounded , they had the right to call in the loan within 30 day dated back to XXXX when the vehicle wa first recovered . Despite taking my payment and my dialogue with them about the insurance claim . They promptly canceled my XXXX payment and my installment plan . And later reported my account a a charge off just day after receiving a settlement check . I have a memo from XXXX laying out the timeline of the claim . Considering I had to hand sign document and mail them from XXXX . I had no control over how long the paperwork and processing of a check took . I have disputed the charge off with each credit bureau showing the XXXX memo . I have asked XXXX XXXX for an adjustment considering I hadnt missed a payment and I wa overseas .

"Experian is failing to conduct investigation and review information ( and document ) supplied a part of consumer dispute . I disputed information provided by XXXX for an account/trade line with Experian on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX . Experian state it completed it investigation on or aroudn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX . However , the result provided by the specialist are for an entirely different account with XXXX . In general , Experian provides the following statement regarding their handling of consumer dispute : `` To help resolve the dispute , we will review all relevant document submitted with the dispute and will forward them to the furnisher if we are unable to resolve the issue . We review and consider the furnishers or vendor response to determine whether to accept it , reject it , or follow up for additional information . If , after processing , we find that the disputed information is inaccurate , incomplete or can not be verified , we then delete or modify that information , a appropriate . If we do not receive a response from the furnisher or the vendor within the required period , we update the item a you have requested or delete the information and send you the result . In some instance , we are able to determine whether the disputed information should be changed or deleted without having to contact the furnisher or the vendor. `` However , had the specialist taken a look at the dispute and the document suppied , the result provided would correspond to the account disputed . It is based upon the result from another accounttradeline that Experian `` verified `` the `` accuracy `` of the account/tradeline under dispute . The information supplied with the XXXX line I disputed clearly show the status of the account is false/inaccurate/misleading under 15 U.S. Code 1681e and the inclusion of such in my Experian credit file violates a Consumer Reporting Agency 's responsibility under the FCRA . Moreover , the `` investigation `` conducted by Experian , having been completed on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , and having arrived at a conclusion of `` accurately `` reported information based upon information for an entirely different account , neither meet the standard for dispute investigation under 15 U.S. Code 1681i , nor enusres the accuracy of the information for the account/tradeline under 15 U.S. Code 1681e . the information reported need not even be `` false `` but may equally be `` correct `` information that give a materially misleading impression ( see : Twumasi-Ankrah v. Checkr , Inc. , 954 F.3d 938 , 943 ( 6th Cir . 2020 ) ) . The fact remains XXXX insists the account wa Charged-off on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , but continues to report it a a continuing account whose past-due balance increase approxmimately ever thirty ( 30 ) day . This would would lead any potential lender to believe there is an oustanding monthly obligation . The fact remains XXXX informed me that the age of the alleged debt barred them from reporting adverse information in my credit file . The fact remains XXXX ceased XXXX paper and electronic statement in early XXXX and wa notified of such via billing error by it own collection agent . The fact remains XXXX had the account returned to them by their second collection agent citing an enumerated list of vilations of federal banking and consumer law , that were initially articulated by me . The fact remains XXXX attempted to re-age the account to resolve the issue , but in doing so created erroneous ( more recent ) period of delinquency that do not exists . The fact is XXXX inability to resolve this on-going issue now lead the account to be reported a 180 day past-due for the fourth month in a row , despite it being allegedly charged-off . The fact remains that Experian ha been provided with all of this information and unlike at least one ( 1 ) other CRA ha decided to do nothing except rely upon XXXX automated XXXXeporting system to `` correct `` inaccuracy , when Experian ha document on XXXX letterhead , supplied in response to CFPB complaint , that contradict the information XXXX continues to furnish to Experian .

They now want me to fill out an `` Identity Theft Affidavit `` which not only asks for thing like my full SS number , my current address , previous address , but also ACCOUNT AND ROUTING NUMBERS for my bank . It is absolutely ludacris . I have spoken to the FTC twice over this matter and wa directed here to file a formal complaint against the company . Given the above and also the many many similar story I read on the XXXX website about Kikoff , I know for a fact that something shady is going on with this company and they need to be investigated immediately . My credit score ha gone down almost 40 point the last few month from OVER 800 because of this identity theft issue and Kikoff is the ONLY company that ha failed at the very most basic of security check throughout the process .

Can we assume it , can we refinance it into our name , is it considered a purchase ? Rates are at an all time low and we would like to get this resolved with a minimal emotional impact a possible . We are not getting any answer and keep trying . I am writing now this complaint a I am at my wit end extremely frustrated a I am sitting on hold for the third hour today . No customer should have to go through this to get some answer . Thank you for your assistance and prompt attention to this matter . XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",Mortgage,Mortgage
"On XX/XX/XXXX I and my son went to XXXX XXXX to take a look at a vehicle for myself . I requested to see a used XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX that wa offered at around $ XXXX . I and my son were taken out to take a look at the vehicle then the rep took me for a test drive in it . My son remained at the dealership until we returned . Upon arrival back to the dealership , I wa speaking with my son concerning the vehicle and asked him to drive it to tell me what his opinion wa . After receiving a decent opinion from him , I began speaking with the auto representative of whom I informed that I had a pre-approval from my credit union . He then invited me to sit down with him at his desk while he spoke with me concerning feature on and in the vehicle . During the conversation with the rep , I inquired about obtaining GAP for the vehicle if I decided to purchase it . He mentioned that they had it for { $ 1000.00 } . I stated that I didnt want to pay that amount for it because I could get it from my credit union for { $ 390.00 } . He then stated that he would provide it to me for the amount that I quoted . He then began to go back and forth , in and out of his office to speak with colleague regarding the vehicle . He eventually mentioned that their establishment could give me a better rate than my credit union and later on he introduced me to the finance manager . We were out in the lobby area and the lady came out claiming that she had a credit union that would give me a better rate after they inquired a to what rate Id been given by my credit union . I said 6.2 and then she stated that she had a credit union that would give me a 5.4 APR ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) . I mentioned that I wanted to discus it with my son . The male rep then asked why do you need to discus it with your son ? Dont you like saving money ? I responded in the affirmative but told him that I still wanted to do this . I walked over to my son to discus matter and then we stepped outside to call my daughter to get her opinion too . After speaking with the both of them , the agreement wa if I were going to get a 5.4 APR and save money , then that wa a decent offer . I decided that maybe Id take the vehicle . We returned back inside and I continued speaking with the male rep in reference to the vehicle . He then took me to the female financial manager 's office to speak with her . She took me into an office to a computer that she had document on . One of the document that she asked me to sign wa one that she stated would grant her permission to retrieve my credit for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . I agreed to allow that , since they were the entity that she stated would be offering the 5.4 APR , so I signed the document . She completed whatever document and told me that XXXX would be sending me document to sign later via electronic signature . She then took me back to the male rep , who took me to the vehicle to explain how some thing worked prior to letting me depart with the vehicle . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX . I received a text message from the female asking if she had the correct phone number for me . I responded in the affirmative , then the mess began with her ( see text message ) . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I texted her after two failed attempt on her part to obtain financing because the 2nd financial institution ( XXXX XXXX ) that she tried rejected the request . When I inquired a to what wa going on , she responded I dont know . I then called her up and told her how about I just bring the vehicle back there and put it back on your lot and be done with it ? She claimed that she wa getting it taken care of . When I inquired on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , she responded stating that she sent all of the signed document to Town Bank , I never signed ANY document for that bank . I only signed document for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX . They both sent me document to sign when I wa supposed to be financing with them and both institution rejected the contract . I also have copy of the document that I signed with both institution . There should not be ANY document signed by me with TOWN BANK . I never agreed to conduct business with them and I did not sign any document with them . If they have a document with my signature , then she ( or someone else she got ) manipulated them . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I messaged her regarding my credit report . I wa checking on my report and had seen that she pulled my credit about 4 time , This made me extremely angry because I wa only aware of her supposedly pulling it for XXXX XXXX . I reached out to her via text to state my position on it and told her not to pull my report again . She responded with `` I wa just trying to get you a better rate. `` On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to inquire because I hadnt heard anything from her since I told her not to pull my credit again . She sent me a text message claiming to have finalized document with TB ; I did not respond . I had spoken with one of my real estate friend concerning this debacle with XXXX staff and this vehicle and she gave me the name of another XXXX representative that she knew . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , I reached out to the lady and explained the situation to her concerning this vehicle and how XXXX wa conducting business . Her recommendation to me wa a soon a you can , return that vehicle to their lot , give the key back and let them know that you dont want to do business with them . She stated that it wa messy and it should not have taken all of that . I got into the vehicle and drove to XXXX XXXX right after I finished speaking with her . I wa accompanied by someone to the dealership . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I walked into XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX and told the manager and the young lady at the front desk that I wa returning a vehicle . They asked me wa it for service ? I responded in the negative and told them that I wa returning it for them to keep . He asked if it had a lien on it ? I told him that nothing wa on it and that it had never been financed . I also expressed my disgust with how his staff member pulled my credit a number of time and I told him that this is not how you do business and I would not be doing business with them . I also stated that if there wa nothing else for me to do then I wa leaving . He and the lady asked me who had worked with me and I provided the name . He said that the female wa there and he left my presence . While I wa inquiring again a to whether I needed to do anything else , the female staff member came out . She spoke and I spoke to her and she began to say something to the effect of we have been in touch , I sent you a message . I said NO , I dont want the vehicle and this is not how you do business . I also addressed the fact that she pulled my credit numerous time . She began to say that I gave her permission and I said to her again , NO , you had my permission to pull my credit for XXXX XXXX and anything beyond that , you shouldve been contacting me ! ! She said okay and then walked away from me . I prepared to depart from the dealership when she eventually walked back over to me and stated the bank is still going to hold you responsible . I said what bank is holding me responsible ? She responded Town Bank . I responded I havent signed any document with town bank and I didnt do any business with Town Bank . She responded okay and walked away from me . I then told the person who accompanied me that I wa ready to leave and we departed . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX someone from a mortgage company did a soft pull on my credit report and told me that the female at XXXX had pulled my credit a total of 15 time . I wa livid when I learned of this because I had only seen it 4 time AND I had a pre-approval when I arrived at the dealer so there wa no sensible reason to pull my credit beyond the one time that I gave permission for . At this time , there wa nothing on my credit report regarding the vehicle in question or TowneBank . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , I reached out to my credit union to obtain another pre-approval for a vehicle . Naturally the rate provided wa higher than the previous one due to the many inquiry on my report . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a text from the female member being sarcastic concerning the vehicle and telling me that I needed to pick up my XXXX or her manager will have it removed from their lot . She also left a message on my phone asking that I return her call to discus the vehicle . I ignored both , the message and the voicemail . I did not make contact with her at all . I wa determined NOT to do any business with that establishment . The vehicle had been returned with no financing , therefore it wa never my vehicle . I had also decided that I would seek legal guidance , so I began to go online researching consumer attorney . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I texted my brother and asked if he would go with me to purchase a vehicle . I spoke with him again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and we agreed to go on the next day ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , I received notification that an envelope had arrived for me from TowneBank . I received an email notification regarding my credit report on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX early , so I checked it a the message suggested . I looked on my credit report ( XXXX ) to find that Town Bank had loaded a bill for { $ 35000.00 } for a vehicle that ( 1 ) wa not in my possession and ( 2 ) that I NEVER purchased from them or anyone else . I immediately checked my XXXX and XXXX report . It wa listed on my XXXX but not the XXXX . I called my brother and told him about it and he postponed the vehicle shopping and told me to take care of this matter first . I reached out to all three and placed freeze on my report until further notice . I went online and submitted a dispute for those that showed up on my report . I also contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) concerning the matter . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX a lady called my phone from Town Bank ( XXXX ) leaving a voice message , stating that she wanted to verify some information with me regarding the purchase of a XXXX XXXX XXXX . I did not return the call because I wa seeking legal representation concerning this matter . She called my phone again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and left a message . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and wa instructed to send documentation to their establishment for review , so I forwarded the document that I have regarding this matter . On XXXX XXXX another lady from Town Bank called my phone requesting that I return her call to ( XXXX ) XXXX . I did not return the call . After various conversation with XXXX staff , one of the attorney instructed me to reach out to TowneBank to obtain a copy of the contract that they are attempting to enforce against me . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX , I called one of the lady who had reached out to me from XXXX to request a copy of the contract . I explained that I had never submitted an application to or signed document requesting a loan from them and that I wanted to have a copy of the contract . I also mentioned that I wa seeking legal guidance . The representative responded that I would need to have the attorney contact them to obtain this . I stated that a a consumer , I wa entitled to a copy since they were claiming that I had submitted it . She eventually provided the address to me . I typed an email request for a copy of the document soon after and submitted it . On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy via email of the XXXX XXXX XXXX from the bank . Upon receipt , I saw that the original document for XXXX XXXX had been duplicated . The financial institution 's name ( XXXX XXXX ) had been crossed out and Town Bank had been handwritten above it .

This process ha taken almost two month with no resolve . -I wa advised that a letter would be provided to me via email stating what Sloan NelNet wa reporting to the credit bureau , but it would take 3-5 business day for me to receive the letter via email . I called on the 5th day to check on the status of the letter and wa then told that I could not receive the letter because it could only be provided to my lender or a credit bureau . I then called , with my lender on the phone , the same day , so that the letter could be sent to their group . My lender group wa notified that there wa no letter to send their group because they were reporting accurately to each credit bureau ( this wa inaccurate ) . -I wa advised to wait until the next day for a status explanation because the previous representative had put a hold on my account . The current representative I wa speaking with did not know why the hold wa placed on my account and could not give the status at the time of my ongoing dispute . -After speaking with a supervisor , I wa advised that they indeed were not reporting inaccurately to each credit bureau .

"I will include several attachment that can more adequately detail these issue but in summary . As soon a I discovered charge that did not belong to me on my account ending in # XXXX , I reported it to Capital One , and they were removed . These two charge were/are for { $ 250.00 } & { $ 51.00 } plus interest , and number unauthorized auto-debit payment each month ... In my initial letter ( attachment # 1 ) you will see that I provided in advance every documentation I could think of to support the dispute and the two charge a not being valid , and requested for this error to be completed within 30-days , which at first Capital One ( `` C.O `` ) did remove . Thereafter they began to write with request for more and more information . See attachment # 2 & 3 , and ( attachment # 4 ) my response to the initial request ( s ) for additional information , on top of what I had already provided in my first certified letter . In my response ( attachment # 4 ) I pointed out that there wa still an additional { $ 31.00 } of interest which still had yet to be refunded . I also thoroughly answered all of these question a best a I could , because not only were these charge unauthorized by me , they were also for what appeared to be charge for an amusement water park , that I wa already a standing annual pas holder for , and therefore would also have no need for individual pass for similar , when I wa also already a holder of a multi-park pas . It appeared to be very after-the-fact , that now C.O . continued to request more and more information , even after faxing the response to there request for more information , with a letter that wa sent so late that there wa barely time to respond in time for the deadline , I did , and re-faxed again anything additional I needed to add to most thoroughly answer whatever I could , without having any more information to provide them , a again , this wa not a purchase that I initiated myself .

Each step along the way I answered all possible question , provided proof of being ( 1 ) billed more than once and having ( 2 ) paid for the same transaction by other mean , ( 3 ) provided proof of alternate payment documentation ( receipt ) ; again , I wa billed by the original merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for Annual Platinum Passes from XX/XX/XXXX , through XX/XX/XXXX .

I made sure I also sent a fax on the day of the deadline so that C.O . wa aware that a letter wa on it way ( attachment # 7 ) ; In attachment # 8 , notice where these two unauthorized purchase have already been removed/adjusted , and a small fraction of the interest , and not the entire interest sum/total . Finally , see in attachment # 9 , where on XX/XX/XXXX , the day following the deadline , Capital One , rebills both the { $ 250.00 } & { $ 51.00 } again , which again had not been authorized .

And since the seller , the listing agent & their preservation company did not disclose known defect that they were aware of ; constitute misrepresentation , so `` Caveat Emptor `` doe not apply when seller & realtor withheld fact of material defect affecting the home and it value , which is not readily observable and are not known to buyer , the seller is under duty to disclose and Florida Statue 475 , FL , ha extended that duty to real estate licensee ( the listing Broker ) selling residential property , see XXXX XXXX XXXX , and since the XXXX showed no such addendum or disclosure were provided , this constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment .

"We started working with XXXX XXXX - Mortgage Loan Officer XXXX # : XXXX about a week ago for a cash out refinance . I spoke with XXXX XXXX on multiple occasion telling her our only intention were to get a 90 % LTV mortgage refinance and that we were n't interested in anything else . XXXX XXXX reassured me that BofA did offer 90 % LTV cash out refinance and even worked up number to show me what we would qualify for if we had excellent credit ( which we do ) . I did not want to pull a credit report unless I knew for sure BofA did in fact offer the 90 % LTV cash out refinance , which she told me yes , multiple time . Yesterday , on X/XX/2017 when we finally consented to a credit pull to finalize the term and rate and get the ball rolling , she then started acting really awkward , quiet , and unhelpful , telling me the `` system `` capped her at 85 % LTV . She also kept mentioning how `` drastic `` the `` number `` had increased in 24 hour . Stating that interest rate have just been skyrocketing . After I asked her why not the 90 % LTV she told me , she did not have an explanation and started getting rude . She kept abruptly telling me , well those are the number I cant do anything about that ( knowing that she had be caught about lying about the 90 % LTV ) . The minute her toned changed after she pulled our credit report ( which is excellent in every area by the way ) I knew that she realized that everything she had told me wa a complete lie and she wa embarrassed and being exposed . The fact that she completely changed her attitude and showed lack of care and customer service wa horrifying . She then started telling me that there are other bank out there that offer 90 % LTV loan and maybe I should try them . I replied , but I am dealing with you and Bank of America right now , why would you immediately go on the defense and try and refer me to another bank ( because she knew she lied and I wouldnt get what I originally inquired about , that she promised me BofA offered , the 90 % LTV cash out refinance ) . She stated since I did n't do a credit pull so she just entered in arbitrary number to get a snapshot of what the loan would look like . Then number were n't even close . Do n't forget , the number she entered are for a loan that Bank of America doe n't even offer , and she knew that . So I asked her if she had been doing this for so long and she see the number on a daily basis , why wouldnt she put more realistic number . She kept repeating because we didnt do a credit pull I had to put something . That answer is n't enough to justify what is transpiring and the event that led up to how we got where we are . If you are entering number ( based on excellent credit ) then the number should almost be spot on if not slightly off when that credit report is pulled . She wa n't even in the ballpark because she baited me with falsification of service and product offered by Bank of America . I then proceeded to ask for a supervisor and she kept saying well he gone for the day , I can have him call you back . I said well patch me thru to the next highest supervisor on duty . She kept repeating he is my manager . I asked for someone higher than him who can formally accept my complaint and listen to my concern . She then hung up on me . I called back immediately and got transferred atleast 3 or 4 time before finally talking to a XXXX XXXX who stated he wa her Manager and that he wa in fact still in the office and wa being XXXX the entire time ( confirming yet another lie from XXXX when she told me that he wa gone for the day ) . He then apologized and tried to defend XXXX by saying she didnt hang up on me and that the phone dropped . Once I spoke to him , I figured she wa lying about the 90 % LTV the whole time . He confirmed that BofA doe n't even offer a 90 % LTV cash out refinance and that the highest cash out refi is in fact 85 % . If I would have known that from the very start I would have never wasted my time talking with Bank of America , nor XXXX for that matter . This is very bad business and people should NEVER under any circumstance be treated this way and mislead this way . I am very upset that I wa lead on and mistreated by a Bank of America representative and just can not believe that people in your company are allowed to act and operate this way . This is fraud . Plain and simple . I wa duped into pulling a credit report for a loan that they said wa offered , when in the end is not even offered . I am sure I am missing a lot of other thing but when you are a frustrated a I am right now , it is very hard to recall every single thing . I hope I wa able to report this individual and get some sort of reprimand because it is bad business and should have never taken place to begin with . If the loan officer would have specified in the very first phone call that they do not offer the product ( s ) and or service ( s ) that we specifically spoke about , the 90 % LTV cash out refinance , then I would have never followed through with anything else . This wa a huge waste of my time and a huge inconvenience , let alone damaging to my health when my XXXX XXXX wa thru the roof after exposing so much . For anyone to condone this type of business and continue to allow it to happen within their staff is just truly mind boggling . As many year a this lady ha been employed with this company doing this line of work , I am almost certain the number of complaint are extremely high and it time that appropriate disciplinary action be taken so this is avoided in the future .",Mortgage,Mortgage

On XXXX XXXX , XXXX , I received a letter from PennyMac that they purchased home owner insurance on my property in the amount of { $ 4200.00 } which they placed on my home in XXXX XXXX . Naturally , I called PennyMac to clear the situation up , but instead I wa subject to being either transferred from department to department several time , with no one knowing what they were talking about , to being placed on hold for several minute until I eventually got frustrated and hung up . I wrote a letter to PennyMac , and they said they reviewed my contract and it showed that I did n't have `` Hurricane Insurance `` only `` High wind `` and that I had let my homeowner 's insurance collapse . Not true ... ( Have all the document to prove it and my insurance company faxed my document to various individual at PennyMac on several occasion to verify the same . ) Also at the time of closing , the Hazard Insurance Authorization Requirements form from PennyMac did not state that `` XXXX `` coverage wa an insurance requirement for escrow of fund . There is no right under the existing mortgage for PennyMac to collect insurance fund without notice to the borrower indicating these new charge . There wa never any notice sent to u with regard to placing this insurance on our property either . In fact the insurance provided by u wa deemed sufficient and there wa no escrow requirement for hurricane insurance imposed upon this loan . On XXXX XXXX , XXXX , I wrote to PennyMac once again requesting for a master copy of the forced placed insurance policy and proof from PennyMac that the premium charged to me wa in fact paid by PennyMac . There ha been no response to this simple request . Finally , I wa left with no choice but to hire an attorney . And every month they continue to spin their wheel telling u that it is in review status . I figured that I would first report them to the XXXX and Consumer Reporting . If they continue to spin their wheel , and not drop these ridiculous charge , we will be left with no other alternative but to sue PennyMac for unfair and deceptive trade practice a well a a Fair Debt Collection Practice violation . So I ask you ? Do you really want to deal with these issue ? Then consider this my gift to you .",Mortgage,Mortgage
I had a Citi Double Cash credit card for 4 year . I had 7 instance of fraud on this account which required them to issue a new card number . Most recently I had 3 instance of fraud in XX/XX/2019 that required them to issue new card number . In each case I have had my physical card in my possession and fraud wa all carried out online . I do n't believe that Citi ha investigated these issue or taken proper measure to protect my account . I also believe that Citi 's employee were in some way responsible for the fraud . I have had several conversation with their customer service and fraud department ( which are all located outside of the United States ) . Nobody ever followed up with my concern even though they claimed they would investigate . The most recent incident involved people signing up for recurring subscription service with my credit card and even after a new card number wa issued they rolled those fraudulent subscription over to my new account . I wa told by one representative that in fraud case they would not authorize any recurring charge on the new account by their policy . So at the very least they are incompetent in following their own policy and at worst they have people working internally that are taking part in fraud against their customer . I have since closed my account with Citi because they are a liability to me but I feel like they should be investigated .,Credit card or prepaid card,Credit card or prepaid card

"Re : Carrington Mortgage XXXX XXXX In XXXX , my wife and I were notified by Carrington that we could participate in a forbearance offer due to COVId . We decided to participate and did so for a period of three month . At the end of that time , we found out that Carrington , without informing u , had reported u to the three credit reporting agency a 60 day late . When we found out this negative information wa on both of our credit report , we made a huge payment to bring the account up to date . Carrington never told u of the limited time of the forbearance , three month , nor that we would be required to make a 2 or 3 month lump sum payment . We were mislead at a time when we were thought we were getting some type of COVId relief . Further the failure of Carrington to timely and clearly inform u that the forbearance had such strict limitation and wa actually not a forbearance is disheartening . At the very least , we want the negative , 60 day late payment , reported by Carrington removed from the 3 credit reporting agency report under our name a at the time we were in the agreed upon forbearance offered by Carrington .

"CFPB 's choice do not allow me to select an accurate description of my problem . After XXXX 's security breach , I placed Security/Credit freeze with all 3 credit bureau . No problem with XXXX , which wa done online . However , Experian and XXXX both told me that `` there were problem `` and that I could not continue ( I have copy of the exact wording if you need them ) . They said I needed to mail them information . Neither told me what wa wrong . So then I called them . Try to find a phone number ! They 've done a great job at making it a difficult a possible to get their phone number , but I did wind up getting number . I wa able to place my credit freeze using the phone and their automated system . At least they told me I had successfully placed a freeze on my account and that they will mail me a confirmation . XXXX did not charge me - it never came up in the automated phone prompt . Maybe because of the mess they created ? XXXX unexpectedly and very rapidly told me my 10-digit PIN which they generated and a confirmation number . I recorded both call ( Experian and XXXX ) and XXXX did give an option to replay the long msg , but poor design . In XX/XX/XXXX I had a dispute with XXXX a they did not have my correct current address , which changed in XX/XX/XXXX . My driver 's license , mailing address , voter registration and even library card all had my current address , but not XXXX ! They even had my mortgage of the house at the address where I wa living but apparently did n't think I lived there . Summary of my complaint : 1 . When they can not process your information , they do not tell you why ( sure , they may purposely want to keep it vague , but I 'm requesting a Freeze , not opening a new acct ) . Here is Experian 's exact wording `` We were unable to honor your request to place a security freeze on your personal credit report based on the information you entered. `` 2 . Wonder why the online method failed , but automated phone system worked . 3 . No phone number are given in their ' can not process ' message . 4 . Finding the correct phone number is difficult . Experian 's IL number ( listed on the site a XXXX ) rang once and disconnected , so I tried their CA number which said they were closed but then gave me the XXXX number which I wa able to use . 5. Credit bureau must face stiffer penalty for poor data quality . They have too much power and are not responsive . If any fraudulent account were opened during the time a credit/security freeze wa attempted and the time it actually happened , which could be a long time if someone used US Mail , they need to be held liable for all expense incurred by the victim .","Credit reporting, repair, or other","Credit reporting, repair, or other"

"On the XXXX of XXXX , 2022 , I clicked on a link from an email that appeared to be from `` XXXX `` . The email address wa XXXX . They used the same logo and type face a XXXX and requested that I fill out a form that wa required for money-laundering . I thought the email wa real . I clicked the link . Nothing happened but a XXXX search page opened . So I opened my account to look for the document . At this time , i started to notice that money wa being transferred out of my account . A total of 9 transaction were attempted . I wa only able to cancel two - that were connected to my personal account . The 7 transaction connected to my business account were successfully completed . As I noticed this wa happening , I frantically tried to stop the transaction but wa unable to reverse them . I tried to report them a unauthorized , but XXXX only gave the option to EMAIL your complaint with a XXXX response time . I tried to call - but the phone number wa not available . I wa left utterly helpless by the corporation a I wa being robbed and there wa no way to close my account , freeze the transaction or disconnect my connected bank account . It wa a complete and utter failure on XXXX behalf to protect it customer . Since I could not reach XXXX I called my two bank account that were connected to my XXXX account to try to stop the transaction from going through . I called XXXX XXXX ( my account in XXXX ) and they blocked all transaction that were not coming through my debit card . No money wa stolen from this account . I called Chase- where my New York based business account wa held and they similarly told me they would block XXXX from further transaction but did NOT block anything . The only thing that wa stopped from going through were transaction that could not be funded due to a lack of fund . I later saw that my Chase account still had an active relationship with XXXX in my account setting , so clearly they failed at their obligation to block and END a linked business account relationship to XXXX . The following day three transaction posted to my business account , wiping out all of my fund and overdrawing my account . The three transaction were for the following amount : XXXX USD , XXXX USD , and XXXX USD . A total of XXXX USD wa successfully debited before Chase took the initiative to block further transaction . The robbery attempted to withdraw almost XXXX from my XXXX account a that is the daily spending limit . ( Which I could also not modify when I wa being robbed ) . I filed claim with both Chase and XXXX- and Chase immediately began an investigation but contacted XXXX who then told them that the transaction were all authorized . This wa and is infuriating , a obviously I had already notified both Chase and XXXX the night that this happened to tell them that the transaction were NOT authorized , nor did I have any idea who these beneficiary were . I called Chase back to contest their finding explaining the fraud and how it happened and they told me that the bank is not liable for returning fund lost in phishing scam , because I obviously gave my contact info to someone . This could not be further from the truth . I clicked a link for a document , NOT to make a payment , NOT with a password , NOT with any permission to open or take my money from my account . I then filed a police report and a report with IC3 - the FBI - and shared that with Chase to further claim that I had not authorized these transaction , and they subsequently denied my claim again . On the other hand , I wa filing a claim with XXXX simultaneously . They explained that Chase had found the claim to be authorized because of the existing business relationship and that I should focus on filing a claim with XXXX since that wa who indeed would be able to refund me IF the transaction were found to be fraudulent . I waited for over two week for a response , and heard nothing . When I finally got my response , XXXX agreed that the charge were fraudulent and unauthorized , but suddenly attempted to shift blame to Chase , saying they would be responsible for refunding me . XXXX had previously told me , in a recorded telephone conversation , that IF they found the transaction to be fraudulent and could not recover the fund , they would be responsible for giving me a refund . NOW they are telling me that Chase will have to do so , and I shouldnt wait for them . Not only is XXXX unresponsive and extremely slow in getting back to you , they are making blatant contradiction in their process and are avoiding giving a refund . They should be responsible for this money since it is their lack of customer service and availability that ha ultimately allowed this fraud to take place","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Checking or savings account

Shell Point could not get it to complete the file , I contacted XXXX for the paperwork they sent me the paperwork in the mail . The people at XXXX asked why I wa requesting the paperwork . I needed to get it due to the privacy act . They stated that Shell Point should have called them since they sold them the account . In XX/XX/XXXX I received a welcome letter in the mail about my payment they wanted 9 payment of XXXX a month I believe it wa about XXXX dollar , On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Shell point Mortgage and the gentleman told me to go ahead and send XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment in the amount of { $ 1600.00 } they should have everything together by then which I did and on XX/XX/XXXX Shell Point Mortgage had returned XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment because they could not accept partial payment , they are still under assumption that I still owe from XX/XX/2016 .

"My student loan have been with MOHELA since I finished XXXX in XXXX . I have had continuous issue with MOHELA since the student loan pause ha resumed- including it taking XXXX month to resolve them miscalculating my standard repayment plan in excess of { $ 80.00 } . On approximately XX/XX/XXXX , MOHELA transitioned my loan from their old platform onto their new platform . On XX/XX/XXXX , I made a { $ 1500.00 } payment towards XXXX of my loan using a tax credit . I received access to my account on MOHELA again approximately XX/XX/XXXX on the new platform . To the date of this filing , that { $ 1500.00 } payment ha still not shown up on my account , so I am being charged interest on a higher rate . Additionally , and more frustratingly - I have been twice double charged by MOHELA . My monthly amount due is around { $ 400.00 } . Since the beginning of the pandemic in XX/XX/XXXX , I have not been signed up for autopay . Once I had access to the new system , I had no access to any previous payment that were scheduled and understood that those payment would not be transitioned over to the new system . As such around XX/XX/XXXX , I scheduled a payment of { $ 430.00 } to be made on XX/XX/XXXX . On XX/XX/XXXX , I schedule a payment of { $ 430.00 } to be withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX . On XX/XX/XXXX , I noticed that MOHELA withdrew { $ 430.00 } from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX , but also { $ 430.00 } on XX/XX/XXXX . I cancelled any scheduled payment on XX/XX/XXXX , including the one scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX . I called and spoke with customer service to report the unauthorized withdrawal and wa told that all they could do wa issue a refund , which would take XXXX business day to process . I asked to speak with a supervisor , who told me that they did n't even see XXXX transaction and it would take XXXX day for a refund to process and that there wa no way to expedite the situation . I called my bank and reported the second withdrawal a unauthorized and the bank returned the fund to my account . The next day , I received a letter from MOHELA to notify me that the `` electronic payment authorized `` by me wa refused , despite MOHELA knowing that the payment from me wa in fact not authorized . On XX/XX/XXXX , I mailed a letter to MOHELA providing documentation regarding the double charge , the dispute , the authorization . As of the date of this writing , no response ha been received from MOHELA in response to that letter . On XX/XX/XXXX , I rescheduled the payment for XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of { $ 430.00 } . As of that date , I had received no explanation a to why my account had previously been double charged . As of the date of this writing , I have been provided with no explanation a to why my account wa double charged . On XX/XX/XXXX , I checked my bank account and noticed that for the second month in a row , MOHELA once again double charged my bank account - XXXX withdraws , both in the amount of { $ 430.00 } were showing a processing on XX/XX/XXXX . I called my bank to confirm that MOHELA had submitted separate request for withdrawal . They confirmed that MOHELA had . They indicated that because the transaction were processing , MOHELA had to cancel the payment . I called MOHELA and spoke with someone for XXXX minute , who wa unable to provide an explanation and wa working on `` investigating `` before I had to disconnect the call because I lost service on my way to work . I called someone back and wa told I had to start the whole process over - I wa on the phone with that person , who wa rather aggressive , for XXXX minute before I had to end the call because I had a work obligation - still no one seemed to understand the issue or be able to provide an explanation . I called back several hour later and spent another XXXX minute on the phone with a customer service representative , who wa unable to provide me with an explanation and insisted that there wa only XXXX payment until I uploaded a copy of my bank showing the XXXX pending transaction . I wa then transferred to a supervisor- which wa actually being transferred to a line that said a supervisor would call me back in up to XXXX business day . Within an hour a supervisor called me back and said he would put in a request to cancel the payment while they figure out why I keep being double charged . When I asked for a letter confirming that the payment wa cancelled , I wa told I could not expect to receive any kind of documentation for XXXX business day . In short , I have twice been told by MOHELA that there is no kind of immediately resolution to them double charging my account . They have at this point essentially twice illegally taken my money in the amount of { $ 430.00 } each time . On XX/XX/XXXX , my bank showed both of the transaction a having gone through .

"I have a student loan that wa serviced by Nelnet . At the beginning of the COVID pandemic , around the time that the pause in interest and principal payment for student loan wa announced , I had contacted Nelnet to get set up for the pause . At that time , Nelnet informed me that I wa not eligible for the pause . I asked what I would need to do to qualify , they ( Nelnet ) told me there wa nothing that could be done to qualify for the pause . So , I continued to make auto-debit payment because at 8 % interest the loan balance would continue to increase significantly . In XX/XX/2022 , I wa informed that I could transfer my loan to the federal government and then qualify for 0 % interest and stop payment during the pause , which I did . After the loan transfer , the 0 % interest wa applied to my loan and payment paused . I believe Nelnet misrepresented my eligibility for the pause originally and they certainly misrepresented the fact that there wa nothing I could do to qualify , when all I simply had to do wa transfer my loan . I am not certain there is much that can be done about that misrepresentation , but I do believe that the following description address the more recent misrepresentation and attempted fraud by Nelnet . I recently became aware that individual who had made auto-debit payment during the pause were eligible for refund of principal and interest . I found this information on the website www.studentaid.gov . The website directed me to contact my loan servicer , Nelnet . When I made the request on XX/XX/2022 , they said they would get back to me within four to six week . When they did contact me on Thursday XX/XX/2022 , they informed me that I wa not eligible for a refund of principal and/or interest because my loan wa not in deferment during that time . Logically this made no sense because if I had been in deferment there would have been no payment made and no money to be eligible for a refund . I do have a recording of the last conversation that I have just described , if that is of any use . The amount that should be refunded to me is approximately { $ 21000.00 } .

"I applied for a cash out refinance loan with CashCall Mortgage ( DBA Impac Mortgage ) on XXXX on my house . I wa told by XXXX XXXX that the interest rate would be 3.625 % with XXXX pt and no fee . I agreed to start the application which included having my credit score pulled from them and have the rate locked in . However , on XXXX I wa told the rate wa 3.75 % and not 3.625 % . I asked why the increase of 1/8 % and I wa told he `` made a mistake and misquoted me `` but he would be willing to adjust the rate if it go lower before the closing date . During the conversation I got the feeling that it wa a bait-and-switch scheme because I kept getting the pressure to do this refinance and kept being told `` I would never be able to find another lender with this rate `` ( well , only this rate never existed to begin with ) . Because they already did a credit inquiry on me which had an impact on my credit score and also because I already started the process , I agreed to what he said so that the application process could continue . On XXXX the rate went down to 3.625 % for a short while and I immediately notified XXXX ( I even attached the rate sheet in the email ) . On XXXX I wa told by XXXX XXXX that his manager XXXX XXXX refused to lower the rate unless I pay cost for it . XXXX XXXX and I had a few heated discussion and even though I had email proof that the rate would be honored and adjusted and I had rate sheet to prove it , he still refused to adjust the rate unless I pay for it . I told them I would file a formal complaint with different government agency and only then XXXX XXXX reluctantly honored the rate of 3.625 % . But then thing quickly went downhill and it wa clearly retaliation - first I wa told by the loan processing officer ( XXXX XXXX ) I would need to contact my HR to fill out a Verification of Employment for employment proof and income proof and after I did that , I found out that a a borrower I wa not supposed to handle this kind of form because it wa clearly a conflict of interest and would potentially make the application illegal - in other word , I wa trapped into doing something that appeared to be helping the application but it wa complete opposite . Then , on XXXX when I signed a new set of disclosure after the adjustment of rate I noticed my SSN is wrong . I followed up with XXXX XXXX and I wa told there wa nothing wrong with the SSN number but then when I sent him a screenshot of the disclosure form I received that contained the incorrect SSN to express my concern , he replied and told me the SSN wa corrected and in the email he quoted my SSN in CLEAR TEXT . It is an unsecured email channel and so now my SSN is out exposed to the public . This is absolutely unacceptable and a complete violation of privacy ! I asked both XXXX and XXXX why they did that and that they did not care about information security and I wa just told this is the normal process in CashCall Mortgage and `` it is what it is `` ( I honestly believe they did that on purpose a retaliation ) . And a if that wa not the end of a nightmare process yet , CashCall Mortgage ran another credit check without my consent on XXXX . It wa a `` hard inquiry `` which negatively impacted my credit score . I caught it because I have credit monitoring service and when I asked CashCall Mortgage I wa told they `` had made a mistake in entering my SSN `` in the application and had to re-enter and do another credit inquiry . I would imagine it is against the law to run any credit inquiry without the consent . And again , another retaliation towards me for asking for the rate I wa promised . After the loan closed towards the end of XX/XX/2019 , I sent an email to the CEO ( XXXX XXXX ) and Chief Administrative Officer ( XXXX XXXX ) about my experience with CashCall Mortgage that includes the bait-and-switch business practice and the retaliation towards me including disclosing my SSN in public and running credit inquiry without consent and the only response I got wa a few phone call from a paralegal ( XXXX XXXX ) . XXXX XXXX pretended to be a nice person at first but then he quickly became extremely aggressive in every call with me in an attempt to intimidate me so that I can let this go and not pursue any further . It is clear to me that they know within their company all these questionable business practice and potentially illegal activity done by their staff ( also confirmed by the numerous complaint other people filed with CFPB on Impac Mortgage/CashCall Mortgage ) but they simply do n't care . I am hereby asking CFPB to look into this company - they have clearly violated a few regulation ( TILA , for example ) - and to evaluate whether this company should have the license to continue doing business in the mortgage lending industry .",Mortgage,Mortgage

"On XX/XX/2022 , my sister XXXX XXXX , who ha been impacted by the coronavirus and ha recently had her own checking account closed at another bank , asked me to deposit a { $ 6300.00 } check she received , into my Chase account . I have a deposited third-party check made out to her in the past without any issue and agreed . The check wa deposited via the mobile app on XX/XX/XXXX . I received a secure message from Chase that the check wa accepted and that there would be a 10-day hold . I do not have a problem with the 10-day hold in my checking account a I understand this is a third party check and wa for a rather large amount . Later that afternoon I received my paycheck from XXXX XXXX . This paycheck wa issued from the XXXX XXXX XXXX / tax controller from XXXX XXXX I am newly employed with XXXX XXXX and direct deposit ha not been set up yet . Therefore , for the first two to three paycheck I receive paper check . My checking account wa overdrawn by a couple XXXX dollar , and because of the hold that wa placed on the XXXX check , I decided to deposit my { $ 1700.00 } paycheck into my saving account . My plan wa to transfer enough money to cover my overdraft and then withdraw a small amount of money to pay bill . Immediately after submitting the check through the ATM in XXXX California , on XX/XX/XXXX , the receipt stated that there would be another hold placed on my paycheck .. not XXXX day , not 2 day , but another 10-day hold . My paycheck from XXXX XXXX will not be available until XX/XX/XXXX . I went to the bank branch in XXXX California on XX/XX/2022 in an attempt to remove the hold.The teller who assisted me stated that because of the { $ 6300.00 } check deposited into my checking account and the hold that accompanied it , a hold wa also placed on my saving account and my paycheck and my account wa restricted . She stayed only the fraud department could determine whether or not the check could be released . She then advised me to bring my sister in with her ID , so that the check could be verified , and then the fraud department would decide if the hold on my paycheck could be released . She also told me if the fraud department determined the restriction and the hold could not be lifted , I would not ever receive the fund from my paycheck . She stated Chase would keep these fund indefinitely Frustrated , but willing to comply with the bank 's request , I returned later that afternoon with my sister who had her ID card a instructed . We were told to sit in the bank 's lobby a a teller made a few phone call . We were not given any information about what wa going on with my account . The teller came over to u at XXXX p.m. , right before closing , handed u our identification card back , and told my sister to bring in the original check for examination and that would be the only way the fund could be released . This wa not what wa told to me when I wa there previously that day . What 's even more outrageous is that per Chase 's recommendation , the XXXX check wa destroyed immediately after I received email notification it had been accepted for processing . This recommendation can be found right on the Chase website . My money is being held XXXX and I can not comply with their ransom demand because I did what their consumer are recommended to do - shredded the check . If Chase wa going to restrict account due to mobile deposit of third party check , then they should not accept these check . If they accepted the check for deposit , they should not punish me by putting a hold on separate fund . Chase ha absolutely no right to earn interest off of my paycheck . This check ha cleared . Yet I am refused access to my money . I have XXXX young child at home , no gas in my car and a cell phone that 's about to be shut off . My food is dwindling . I do not have until XX/XX/XXXX to wait for money . Both of my parent have just died of XXXX and I have nobody I can ask for financial help from . Remove the hold , Chase .

Because of the weak customer support system , the scammer got my laptop and my money , which is { $ 1500.00 } worth at least . And PayPal even let the scammer cancel my account or report my account that I can not log in at all to check any status of my account to cutting loss .

I wa n't sure what the interest would be , so I paid extra ( not much , it wa like { $ 100.00 } ) and figured either the extra would sit on the account a a credit or would be refunded . Problem is , I never got either . There wa no credit on the account and there wa no refund . I spent day in the phone tree - again being transferred around and hung up on . I tried their chat/email - and just got message back to call them . My last message wa a threat to file a complaint with you at that time and then magically I got a refund . This time I 'm not going to waste so much time . While typing this I have attempted to contact them again , but have been on hold for 20 minute so far waiting for a supervisor . My guess this phone call will , too , be disconnected . I am asking for your assistance to get my account corrected with Bank of the West . And I strongly recommend you look into their loan servicing practice . I am very familiar with loan and loan servicing . The accuracy on this is terrible .

I asked if this would put my home in jeopardy and he told me no . XXXX and XXXX roll around and still no packet . I contacted Ruoff numerous time from XXXX to XXXX always waiting on hold for an hour or more or being disconnected multiple time . Should I of called more , yes but I doubt I would of ever been able to speak to a human in less than an hour . I wa also taking care of a XXXX yr old and a XXXX yr old all the while working 40 hour a week .

It is absolutely humiliating and is causing undue stress to my family . With this being my first mortgage I didnt know any better . Now I do .

I also know that due to the fault of Ruoff my home is now in foreclosure . I did file a complaint with the XXXX and wa advised by XXXX to let it close out since he is working with me directly . I did just that . I received a message from them on my complaint stating they sent me numerous email , letter and left voicemail . They did not . I had missed call with no voicemail .

"RE : Property Taxes For year , I have received a check made out to me and my municipality to pay my property tax .

On XX/XX/2024 , I sent a message to Freedom Mortgage asking where the check wa a I had not received it . I wa told that they sent it directly to the city on my behalf , which wa news to me . I looked at my account and there wa a tax disbursement from my escrow account for { $ 5800.00 } in XXXX of XXXX . I assumed this went to the city . In XXXX , I received a delinquency notice from my city that property tax have not been paid and there wa a penalty on my account . I spoke with my municipality and wa told there wa no payment made for my property tax and no fund received . I informed Freedom Mortgage of this XX/XX/2024 . I spoke with Freedom Mortgage and they said they would reissue my tax payment . Another payment of { $ 5900.00 } ( actual property tax bill amount ) wa paid and issued to the city + another { $ 170.00 } pulled out for the late penalty . I called my city and they verified this had been paid . I then received a letter from the mortgage company stating that my escrow account wa short and they would be raising my monthly payment by over $ XXXX to pay off the shortage starting XX/XX/XXXX XXXX . The problem is that there is no shortage , they pulled fund twice from my escrow account and did n't put the first payment back in ! So it is showing that I paid almost { $ 12000.00 } in property tax on my ~ { $ 6000.00 } bill . I then called and spoke with Freedom mortgage on XXXX on XX/XX/2024 . I explained the situation to multiple people who said they would escalate this to the tax team , research team , and refund team and that this would be resolved by XX/XX/XXXX . I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX , after not hearing from anyone by the XXXX . There wa no record of anything being done , this being escalated to any team , or even a supervisor assigned to my case . I did receive a call back from a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX that they are escalating this to the tax team , research team , and refund team . This is exactly what they said wa going to happen almost a month earlier . Today I received a message from Freedom Mortgage that the payment of { $ 5900.00 } wa confirmed through my XXXX and that my tax are current . This wa never the issue ! The issue is that they stole about $ XXXX from my account , wo n't give it back , charged me for the delinquent penalty that they caused , wo n't acknowledge their mistake , and are raising my monthly payment by over { $ 500.00 } for no reason ! I do n't want to have to get a legal team involved but this ha been going on for 3 month . I just want MY money back in MY escrow account .",Mortgage,Mortgage

"In XXXX I noticed that my credit score dropped but I had n't made any credit purchase and all my bill were current ( so i thought ) . I contacted the credit bureau they said that Infiniti XXXX wa reporting late payment . My wife is a co-borrowers on this account . She filed for bankruptcy and her lawyer listed the Infiniti account in her bankruptcy , unbeknownst to me . I called Infiniti XXXX to get an understanding of what wa going on , a well a to explain what I believed wa happening . I have never been 30 day late on this account but because we were not getting any bill , I missed the next due payment . I wanted to make sure we were not missing anymore payment and to possibly get some type of courtesy because of my good payment history so I called Infiniti . I spoke to a representative who told me the account wa in the loss mitigation , there would be no reporting on the account because of bankruptcy and no payment will be taken from my wife or me , nor would they be sending statement . I call back and speak with a gentleman in Loss Mitigation and again he told me that because this wa in a bankruptcy , no reporting wa to be done on this account with the credit bureau , he couldnt take a payment from me and they would not send me any billing statement even though I wa not apart of the bankruptcy ( I am the principal borrower ) . So I am under the assumption that no payment can be made , so I hold the fund in an account . I then get another message from the credit bureau that my credit score ha now went from XXXX to XXXX because Infiniti IS reporting late payment for me . I contacted the Infiniti bankruptcy or loss mitigation to see what step to take to go forward with this inaccurate reporting . A rep say there wa nothing that she could do about this but I could write a letter . I said I would rather speak to someone to get this started and asked to speak to a supervisor and she said the supervisor would tell me the same thing but she would transfer me . Speaking to the supervisor XXXX XXXX of Loss Recovery , she acknowledged that the account wa in bankruptcy but I am not in bankruptcy so although payment are due for me and not my wife , they still cant take any payment , but I can go through a 3rd party to make payment and there wa nothing else that I could do . I explained to her that when I spoke with someone in her dept previously , they said it should be no reporting on this account because it is in bankruptcy and I wont receive statement because it is in bankruptcy . The supervisor proceeded to say it is my issue and there is nothing else that can and will be done and it is what it is . The bankruptcy Lawyer also acknowledged that while this account wa in bankruptcy there should not be any reporting on it and that he would be happy to report that to Infiniti XXXX . After not receiving ANY customer service , I paid the 2 month to bring the account current , but Infiniti declined to report my payment , saying I needed to have a document of Reaffirming the car , but this is not a car loan , but a lease and according to the attorney , there should be no reaffirming on a lease vehicle . Inifiniti then sends a letter in the mail to me and a separate letter my wife ( attached ) saying that unless this indebtedness ha been excepted , I am not obligated or liable to this account , and if I want to continue receiving statement , to sign and return the letter . Both my wife and I mailed the document back but nothing wa done . I wa never in bankruptcy but half of infinitis bankruptcy rule apply to me , while others dont . The result of this issue ha caused my credit which wa otherwise good to be destroyed during this covid , financially strapped environment because of these 2 payment that we were not billed because of the bankruptcy but wa reported to the credit bureau .

On Sunday , XX/XX/year > , I called a customer service representative and asked if I wa eligible and they said I wa . I asked if I needed to do anything to secure this promotion and they said that I did not and that all I needed to do wa make a purchase . I then purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from Cabelas . I chose to use the financing because I have a high interest saving account where I could continue to earn interest , while paying off a large purchase over 12 month at 0 % interest . After making my initial payment , I called the same customer service number ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/year > to confirm they received my payment and that I wa all set to continue paying the promotional rate . It wa then I wa informed there wa no such promotional rate . They confirmed the record of my XX/XX/XXXX call , and I wa told by several supervisor that even though I wa provided incorrect information , there wa nothing that could be done if I did not pay the full balance , I would then be charged interest on my purchase . To add insult to injury , two of the supervisor I spoke with had no remorse , and one insinuated that I didnt read the letter correctly . I wa told the best that could be done wa that they would coach the rep who provided me incorrect information . I dont blame the supervisor , the reality is that they clearly dont have the resource to do right by customer based on Capital Ones own communication . I called the Cabelas store in XXXX , XXXX and asked to speak to the local Cabelas Club manager . I communicated that this experience lost Cabelas my business for good . He said that he ha had this happen previously with customer who received similar letter , only to find out that they didnt have the advertised financing and had to pay . He said he ha seen the letter and thought they were misleading and in a few instance wa able to get Capital One to reverse course , but also wa unsuccessful . Fortunately , I have the resource and saving to pay off my balance . But what about someone else who doesnt ? They would be locked into paying interest on a purchase even though Capital Ones own representative told them they werent going to have to . How is this acceptable ? You should also know that when I asked for something in writing to confirm that you had a record of my XX/XX/XXXX call I wa told that Capital One cant confirm that . How doe this make sense ? To me , it appears these are predatory practice designed to mislead customer so that the bank can trap them into a payment arrangement that benefit Capital One . Why would you send a letter about promotional financing that isnt available ? Why would a representative tell me I wa eligible when I called to ask when I wasnt ? Then when I wa responsible and called to confirm the rug wa pulled out from under me , with no recourse . Not only have you lost a Capital One customer , but Cabelas ha lost a customer .

"In XX/XX/XXXX , I took out an auto loan to purchase a vehicle , from XXXX XXXX XXXX . My identity wa stolen around the same time that year , which ha been reported to my local police department , all of my creditor , and credit reporting agency . Because of the cost associated with handling the identity theft , I fell behind on auto loan payment . I contacted XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to see if their hardship department would work with me . They disagreed , and my loan wa defaulted on inXX/XX/XXXX . In late XX/XX/XXXX/ early XX/XX/XXXX , XXXX repossessed the vehicle , without any written notice . The repossession agent never left any notice that the car wa indeed repossessed . I called my local police department ( thinking it might have been stolen ) , and they told me to try calling my bank , and one of the officer saw `` a car being towed `` while in my neighborhood for another reason . I called XXXX to see where the car wa , a I had valuable and personal belonging in the car , and to ask why I never received anything in writing . They refused to speak to me , insisting that I would be sent a `` Notice of Repossession `` in the mail . They then refused to give me the name and location of the repossession agent , and made it impossible to retrieve my personal belonging , all the information would be available in the letter they were sending to me . I eventually got the `` Notice of Repossession `` , which simply stated the date and time that the repossession occurred , and the delinquent balance of my auto loan . I called XXXX again , a I needed to get my belonging from my vehicle . They finally provided me the address of where the car wa , and gave me instruction on how I could retrieve my belonging . Theyinstructed me to bring the key to the vehicle to surrender to therepo agent , or it would cost more for me to get the car back when I had that opportunity . I went to the location , prepared with an itemized list of my belonging to collect , and to deliver the key to the car that I had in my possession . However , when I got there , the owner of the place denied me any access to my car or it 's belonging . He would n't even agree to take the extra key to the car . He said I wa legally not allowed to be there , and that I would need a court order to collect my belonging . I knew this wa not true , otherwise XXXX would n't have instructed me to go there . The value of the item in the car were worth ~ { $ 1800.00 } , { $ 700.00 } of which wa cash . Some other item included a pair of sunglass , XXXX , phone charger , CD collection , etc ... There wa also a video camera that had the only video of my sister 's wedding , and my late father pocket watch , which had an incredible amount of sentimental value . Those are just some , not all , of the item I neversaw again . Not being able to retrieve them angered me , so I called an attorney to see what my option were . He said there wa no point in making a scene at the repo agent , and suggested I call XXXX again . At this point , XXXX refused to speak with me over the phone anymore , and insisted that they would be communicating with me through certified mail . I spoke with the attorney further , and he explained to me that under New Jersey law , XXXX had to send me a `` Right to Redeem `` notice , giving me the opportunity to pay off the loan ( or bring it current ) and the repo charge within a certain period of time . He said that If they are planning a public sale , then they must state the scheduled date of the sale ; if a private sale , then they must give me at least 10 day notice . While waiting for this notice , I had finally gotten my identitytheft situation sorted out , which took a huge financialburden off of my back . In the first week of XX/XX/XXXX , my mother decided to gift me the money to buy back my repossessedvehicle from XXXX . This would have allowed me to repurchase the vehicle without having to leverage bankruptcy towards XXXX . I notified XXXX of this through certified letter , and over the phone . I wa told that I would have to wait for the `` Right to Redeem `` notice in the mail.I waited and waited , still paying insurance on the vehicle throughout this entire process . I sent a letter everyweek to XXXX , stating I wanted to make the loan current , repurchase the vehicle outright , and that I 've yet to receivemy `` Right to Redeem `` notice.Each timeI called , they said that I had to wait for the notice , and there wa nothing they could do until then.I never got any letter from XXXX . They never sent me a `` Right to Redeem `` notice . The first letter I got from XXXX after that , came in XX/XX/XXXX . The notice stated my balance due , after the sale of the car . Infuriated , I called the attorney who helped me before , when I wa unable to retrieve my belonging from the vehicle . He had me call XXXX , on a conference call . We were transferredto the escalation department , where we spoke to a supervisor , detailing the entire situation . He confirmed that the vehicle wa sold in a private sale , and that a `` Right to Redeem `` notice wa NOT sent to me . He also confirmed the date of the sale , which wa well before XXXX gave me the repo agent 's information . Meaning , XXXX had already sold my car when they sent me to the repo agent to collect my belonging from the car . That is why the repo agent denied me access . At this point , I threatened a lawsuit , because of not being able to retrieve my belonging from the vehicle , and not having the opportunity to pay off the loan . My attorney agreed that there wa enough evidence to file a suit against XXXX for their negligence in the matter . Because XXXX acknowledged their wrong doings at so many instance , they agreed to forgive the remaining balance , and close the account a `` Current `` . I wa n't happy about it , a I still wanted my personal belonging , and the chance to have my vehicle back . The value they sold it for wa significantly less than the market value of the car , and it wa illegal for them to not notify me that they were selling the car . However , my attorney reminded me that it would be virtually impossible to get my belonging back , let alone the car , and that this wa a pretty generous offer from XXXX . So we both agreed to accept the deal . To this day , XXXX never honored this deal . I 've hired other attorney ( the original one I consulted with ha since passed away ) , credit repair agency , etc .. and XXXX ha yet to do anything . They have been reporting this account a `` Derogatory `` , `` Charged off a bad debt `` , and `` Profit and loss write-off `` . What 's worse is that they have been reporting this debt with a balance of { $ 4300.00 } , which wa originally agreed to be forgiven . I 've disputed this information with the three major credit reporting agency , and XXXX ha not provided any documentation , only stating that the reported information is `` correct `` . I 've sent them certified letter , requesting proof of this debt , which have all gone unanswered . Even after dispute , credit bureaushave not included my statement when reporting this account . It'sunacceptable . What bother me the most is after one dispute with Equifax , XXXX added a remark saying `` fixed rate `` , with nothing else . This remark alone dropped my credit score by 49 point , and it wa triggered by a simple dispute . In summary , XXXX can not provide evidence that they notified me of my `` Right to Redeem `` . In fact , their record show that their own representative confirmed I wa never notified about the sale of the car . They have acknowledged this wa illegal on their part , according to New Jersey law . They have been refusing to respond to direct dispute I 've submitted personally , and through credit bureau . Most importantly , they have not honored the deal made with them to drop a civil suit against them in the matter .","Credit reporting, repair, or other",Vehicle loan or lease

It is my belief that their FICO score wa updated to my individual American Express account during an account review of their account . It really is the only explanation .

"In XX/XX/XXXX , I received a loan from XXXX XXXX for flooring . The salesman indicated that I could take advantage of a 12 month no interest loan . Having done these type of loan in the past , I agreed to it . I knew that I would be able to pay the loan balance , which wa a little over { $ 4000.00 } before the accrued interest would kick in . I walked away believing that I had not payment due , including interest , until 12 month after the loan origination date . In XXXX I received a statement and there wa language stating that if I didnt pay the entire balance by XX/XX/XXXX , that I would have to pay the accrued interest . Again I believed that I had just under 1 year to pay the loan if I didnt want to pay interest . In XXXX I received a letter telling me that I had missed a payment for XXXX . I wa confused because I thought I had a year before I had to make payment . The payment due date , a I learned , wa XX/XX/XXXX . Additionally , my XXXX payment wa due on XX/XX/XXXX . In XXXX after receiving the delinquency letter , I contacted Synchrony Bank and explained my concern that the program seemed confusing and misleading . On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment to cover both the XXXX payment and the XXXX payment , which had a due date of XX/XX/XXXX . After making the XXXX payment I schedule payment to be auto-payed up through XX/XX/XXXX . During late XX/XX/XXXX , I checked my credit report and saw that Synchrony Bank had reported that I paid on time in both XXXX and XXXX , but that I wa 30 day late in XXXX . The 30 day late is not accurate . For XXXX , my payment due date wa on the XXXX . My payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX for { $ 160.00 } ... just 13 day beyond the due date . However Synchrony bank reported that I wa 30 day late to the XXXX credit bureau . I called Synchrony Bank to express my concern and wa told that I wa reported late because they had generated a new statement prior to my payment posting . They explained that the 30 day late clock begin to run at the Statement generation date and doe not begin with the payment due date . So if the XXXX Statement wa generated on XX/XX/XXXX , and if I made my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX ... the payment would be reported a 30 day late ... when it really be only 9 day past the due date of XX/XX/XXXX . I would like for Synchrony to remove the 30 day late for XXXX from my credit report , a it is really misleading to start a past due clock based on a statement generation date and not on the payment due date .","Credit reporting, repair, or other",Credit card or prepaid card

"First let me preface this complaint with a history of how this all came to be . XX/XX/XXXX I completed paying off a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy , and received the final discharge in XX/XX/XXXX . Around XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from XXXX XXXX welcoming me back and reminding me of my student loan payment which would be starting up , and approximate payment , and if any change in income let them know . So since my wife is in custodial care in a XXXX home and I am on fixed income of Social Security , Federal retirement , and 50 % XXXX XXXX . My wife 's income go to the XXXX home . I filed the paperwork and waited to hear . In XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from someone named XXXX XXXX to talk about student loan and repayment . She appeared to have my record and did discussion of consolidation ( I wa paying payment on loan which had been consolidated since XX/XX/XXXX , and my payment were up to date until I received forbearance and deferment . I said I do n't believe that wa necessary but she told me oh , if we get your loan from XXXX then they reconsolidate them . Now , bear in mind I wa under the impression I wa talking to 'XXXX XXXX ' or XXXX XXXX . Then I wa told they would take { $ 50.00 } a month to handle paperwork or { $ 990.00 } total . I did n't know if XXXX set this up , if something new , but I did n't want another bill on top of my student loan , since that would be one third of income and leave me stranded for rent and living expense . So I paid with my debit card and noted `` The Student Loan Help Center `` and they were adamant about me recording something about the payment . So then they emailed required document and one which stood out wa ' a limited power of attorney ' to allow them to handle my financial account to work out payment with XXXX XXXX XXXX I called my bankruptcy lawyer for advice and he called it a scam . I called XXXX XXXX and the rep told me to contact the XXXX Attorney General , and XXXX XXXX XXXXl , change my card , and notify my bank . Now , they granted provisional credit but said they had seen the merchant wa in the right . Really ? A phone call and payment suffices over a bank customer ? I imagine they did a much checking a seeing any coffee left in the pot . So XXXX returned the provisional credit and they lived happily ever after . In the meantime , I want to know how this front cover for Brevis consulting had my student loan record . Were it not the timing of waiting on my bill from XXXX XXXX this company would have never gotten a dime . I have dealt with student loan since XX/XX/XXXX and no charge have ever been required . Even my consolidation fee were rolled over . The fact is , this is a third party organization fleecing people who believe they need help in taking care of student loan . At a cost . So I paid a hefty sum ( if you compare ratio of payment to debt ) and no recourse . The AGs will go blah , blah , blah , but nothing accomplished . I want to know how my record were obtained , sitting there and spewing off my account , doing a conciliation on loan that had already been done , and these people have n't done anything since they do n't know the first thing about forbearance , deferment , oh , and they sent my file for no payment . Well , if you have been public service ( I think Federal employee did plenty of public service ) , but the point is you have to pay at least 10 year of payment before you qualify for forgiveness , point being these 3rd party personnel do not know what they need to know . So , basically , what money I managed to save , since I ca n't work with XXXX and XXXX XXXX , so I am limited . But these XXXX get to go about the business of taking advantage of charging people for something that is free.I want my money back , and I want those 3rd party shop closed . You try and pay your loan and these people come along , misrepresent themselves , and when accosted , it is like too bad !",Debt collection,Student loan

"There are 2 issue : the first is Chase not following up with my issue a promised , and the second more serious one is deceptive practice in what price and fare class are made available to customer using the XXXX XXXX XXXX looking to REBOOK flight using XXXX XXXX XXXX . I booked a trip in XXXX using Chase XXXX XXXX . I canceled my trip and had airfare credit ( XXXX XXXX ) redeemable only through Chase XXXXXXXX XXXX for two ticket total { $ 480.00 } . It wa unclear through the portal whether I had to just rebook my flight by the date that XXXXXXXX XXXX had noted or if I had to complete my travel by then because the instruction note that the rule abide what the Airline policy is . XXXX XXXXXXXX ha a policy where you just need to REBOOK travel by a certain date , but travel can occur in the future . To get clarification on this , I contact Chase XXXX XXXX After a lengthy phone call with them , I asked Chase to send me a confirmation email of the rule . They gave me a case number but never followed up . On XX/XX/XXXX I called again about this credit . Though I never heard from Chase , I decided to use my airline credit in advance of the expiration date . I logged into Chase XXXX XXXX to look for flight . I saw the flight option available to my on the portal and tried to rebook . The Chase portal prompted me that I needed to call to use this credit toward my flight rather than being able to do it online . I called an agent and told them I am on the XXXX XXXX portal and have identified the flight I want to use my credit toward . They informed me that for rebooking using existing airline credit , they are only able to offer me DIFFERENT FARES that are higher than is listed on the XXXX XXXX XXXX . It wa NOT a matter of fare difference that can change live at the time of researching flight . They told me that NEW booking versus REBOOKINGS have entirely different price . But those are NOT reflected on the XXXX XXXX XXXX where a customer should reasonably able to access them in order to make an informed decision on what are the actual price available . I told them that wa misleading and not transparent because whatever price I am able to view a my option on my XXXX XXXX XXXX should reflect the real option available to me to use . If the XXXX XXXX XXXX clearly noted that REBOOKING flight had different price and option , then I would not complain . But this portal misleads customer looking to rebook using credit because the TRUE price and option are not reflected . Again , it is not a matter of price changing live a I wa looking in the portal . The agent repeatedly confirmed that REBOOKING flight option are not visible to the customer on that portal . For example , one of the flight I wa interested in wa from XXXX to XXXX , XXXX XXXX flight XXXX for { $ 180.00 } main class . I wa on the phone live with the agent and no matter how many time I refreshed the page , I wa still able to see this flight option but she said the cheapest one for that flight available for customer who are trying to REBOOK rather than book a NEW flight wa { $ 230.00 } . If that wa the case , then the { $ 230.00 } should be visible to me in that portal with a CLEAR note that the { $ 180.00 } and other reflected price are for NEW BOOKINGS ONLY . XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ha a lack of transparency that doe NOT disclose higher price to customer . In total I spent over 3 hour talking to customer service agent who have not been able to provide any reasonable solution . The last call on XX/XX/XXXX wa XXXX hour and XXXX minute long alone . Today XX/XX/XXXX , Chase emailed me saying that they can not refund my my point or give some resolution and attribute it to changing live price that are subject to availability . They are mischaracterizing my issue . It is NOT about live price that are changing . It is about the TRUE cost of flight not being transparent and made visible to customer looking to use existing airline credit . If cost to rebook flight are separate and not the same one on the portal , that should be clearly communicated and visible in the portal when customer try to rebook so that customer can make an informed decision with real price reflected .",Credit card or prepaid card,Credit card or prepaid card

"I have uncovered deceitful and unfair practice of how bank of america is assessing overdraft fee . As of XX/XX/2018 my actual bank balance ( posted transaction ) wa + { $ 89.00 } ( in the black ) . However , there were 4 pending transaction totaling { $ 120.00 } . After accounting for the pending transaction , my `` available balance `` wa negative { $ 31.00 } As a result , and based on my `` available balance `` , which factored in the 4 pending transaction , I wa hit with two { $ 35.00 } overdraft fee on XX/XX/2018 . On XX/XX/XXXX , I could finally see all of the activity from XX/XX/XXXX ( this is not visible through online banking feature until the next business day ) . So I called to ask Bank of America how much money I needed to put into my account in order to ensure I did not incur any additional fee since the same 4 transaction that were pending on XX/XX/XXXX were still pending on XX/XX/XXXX and no new transaction had taken place . I wa advised that one of the 4 transaction ( a { $ 29.00 } annual auto renew subscription from XXXX ) would result in a { $ 35.00 } overdraft fee . It is unfair , deceitful , and possibly illegal for Bank of America to factor in all pending transaction when determining the `` available balance `` that is used a the basis for determining which posted transaction trigger an overdraft fee . It is fraudulent to then charge a customer an overdraft fee on the pending transaction when they finally do post since they were already factored into the historical balance used to determine overdraft fee . If pending transaction were excluded from the overdraft assessment , then I would not have incurred any overdraft fee on XX/XX/XXXX , but they were . Bank of America can then not treat them a newly incurred overdraft incurring transaction when they do post . I remember the day when bank would manipulate the order in which same day transaction posted to an account in order to maximize the overdraft fee they could charge ( regardless of the timing of when those transaction actually occurred during that day at the retail terminal ) . This practice is now illegal . I have uncovered a new way in which Bank of America is manipulating the way in which they double count pending transaction against a customer to incur overdraft fee . They are manipulating pending transaction ( both while pending and again on the very same transaction when they post ) in calculating the balance used to assess overdraft fee .

"Complainant is alleging that Wells Fargo acted not in his/her best financial interest by having him/her to agree to a second loan modification on XX/XX/XXXX , that lowered the interest rate from 7 % to 5 % but extended the FHA mortgage maturity date by another XXXX year ( until XX/XX/XXXX ) , which is not what the complainant agreed to . In fact , the Complainant doe not even recall requesting a XXXX loan modification from Wells Fargo because he/she had already completed a XXXX loan modification from Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX . The term of that loan modification had a maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX and left the original interest rate at 7 % . Complainant is alleging that the mortgage on his/her property should now be paid off , based on the XXXX loan modification . The unpaid principal balance wa { $ 44000.00 } . That loan amount from the XXXX modification still show up today on my mortgage loan from XXXX . However , under the term of the XXXX loan modification , the unpaid principal balance wa changed from { $ 44000.00 } to { $ 51000.00 } , and the maturity date wa changed from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX . To this day , the `` revised `` unpaid principal balance wa never reported a the loan amount on the Wells Fargo app that is being used to pay the mortgage on a XXXX basis . The { $ 44000.00 } unpaid principal amount is still showing a the `` original loan amount `` on the Wells Fargo app . The bank is refusing to acknowledge that a costly mistake ha been made by extending the maturity date . This mistake is causing undue financial stress on the Complainant who belief that Wells Fargo ha committed FHA mortgage fraud in the processing of the XXXX loan modification so that the customer will at some point in the future default on the loan , enabling the bank to foreclose on the property . Complainant ha tried to work with Wells Fargo to resolve this situation , but the bank is not willing to own up to it own mistake . Complainant would have never agreed to pay a mortgage on his/her personal residence for a period of XXXX year . The FHA mortgage originated XXXX and wa assumed by the Complainant in XXXX . The maturity date on the original mortgage wa supposed to be XX/XX/XXXX . However , by Wells Fargo executing the XXXX loan modification , the bank saw fit to make more money off of the Complainant by extending the loan maturity to XX/XX/XXXX . Complainant alleges that the bank did not act in the best financial interest of the customer and wa only trying to increase bank profit by offering an absurd XXXX loan modification that clearly violates the Complainant 's consumer right .",Mortgage,Mortgage

"After leasing a vehicle from XXXX XXXX for three year , with all monthly payment made in a timely manner , and all maintenance performed at the dealership from where I leased the vehicle in a timely manner , I turned the car back , after a one month extension expired . I paid { $ 380.00 } for the lease extension fee and another { $ 1200.00 } for outstanding tax . Each payment wa paid by separate check . On or about the third week of the extension , I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me that I wa delinquent with the monthly lease payment and that I need to make the payment immediately ! I politely told this individual that he must be mistaken for I made both the lease payment and the tax payment . And , without missing a beat this person told me that if I didnt make the payment now that my car would be repossessed ! This made me very upset and I informed this caller that he just violated the FDCPA because I didnt think that Hyundai wa ready to repossess the car from a customer with a history like mine at this point ! I then informed this person that my lease payment cleared my bank on the XX/XX/XXXX in the amount stated above , to which he replied that they applied those fund to tax ! And at point I requested to speak to a supervisor ! A supervisor named XXXX came on the line and I told her everything that occurred with the previous individual and other thing that wa wrong since the extension began such a the notice I received from the DMV regarding the car registration and the fact that I wa told not to register the car for that wa Hyundais responsibly . And after expending { $ 250.00 } on insurance , plus the lease and tax fee , I wa told that I should go register the car where another { $ 100.00 } registration fee wa paid , in addition to { $ 120.00 } for taxi fare wa incurred . XXXX then told me that nothing more wa due Hyundai . I asked her if that meant I didnt owe anymore tax and she said that wa correct . The last week of the extended lease I had to bring the car to the service department for a thermostat . And being the XX/XX/XXXX week I wa told that the car most likely wouldnt be ready until Thursday the XX/XX/XXXX and I called on the XX/XX/XXXX but wa told that it wouldnt be ready until Monday the XX/XX/XXXX ! So on the XX/XX/XXXX I got the car out of service , wa given a receipt , then immediately drove back into the service area to return the car to Hyundai . I wa given a receipt from the return people then went home . Approximately two to three week later , I received a notification of excess wear and tear charge , among others , in the amount of { $ 740.00 } for damage to the tire and curb rash on the wheel . Enclosed therewith were picture showing gouging in three out of four tire , with extensive wheel rash ! I wa amazed and in disbelief because after three year I only put XXXX mile on the car and the car wa in perfect shape ! I immediately contacted the dealer ( XXXX XXXX , of XXXX , Connecticut ) and notified them both verbally and in writing that this damage wa not caused by me ! I also contacted XXXX XXXX to inform them . Both the dealership and XXXX XXXX denied any responsibility and in my pursuit of finding fact I began to review both the service receipt and the turn back receipt where I discovered that approximately 90 mile were put on the car while in possession of the dealership during the service they performed ! Then after more than a month or two of constant communication the dealership agreed to pay for the excess damage charge . It wa just about this time the I found out that XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted derogatory reporting to the credit reporting agency which in my opinion wa inaccurate , done in bad faith , and hurtful a my score went from a high good rating down to a fair score . My argument wa that Hyundai cant misapply my lease payment to tax , then call me delinquent , then report me to the credit agency ! They were aware that I wa disputing the debt and I wa proven correct so far a with the excess wear and tear damage . The information they reported wa inaccurate and just plain wrong , their reporting of due date were arbitrary and not binding a the debt wa in dispute . Furthermore , they were somewhat responsible for the delay since I could never talk with the same individual , that the issue at hand wa beyond their authority and when they indicated that a supervisor would have to call me back , I never received a callback ! So now it out of control but tonight I did receive a call and a few issue were addressed . However , I wa told that the credit department would review this reporting issue but they will only remove perhaps the first derogatory but not the others . This is unacceptable to me for the reason stated above .",Vehicle loan or lease,Vehicle loan or lease

"To SLS : I called on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up on the receipt of the request of the modification review and still to no avail wa the document looked at or even in the system after being sent to you on XX/XX/XXXX , XX/XX/XXXX , & XX/XX/XXXX . A NEW SALE DATE wa set by the XXXX COUNTY SHERIFFS office on XX/XX/XXXX of a new date of XX/XX/XXXX . This gave me 56 day to have a REQUEST of Modification/Workout on the loan by Specialized Loan Servicing on behalf of XXXX . I had 2 representative send me to other department and keep me on hold for XXXX minute or more ( which is all documented ) . Finally a representative said there is no supervisor to speak to and will put a request in for a call back which can take 24 - 48 hour . I received a call this evening XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX and have been again transferred around put on hold and then hung up on . I called back and have been told the New Sale date still is not updated in the system of XX/XX/XXXX and they have no document . I find this to be very concerning a the same email address that I have been using this entire process now is n't transferring the document to you a you stated and I think that you are doing this intentionally . After calling back again and getting another representative named XXXX and I explained the entire situation again , he wa able to now verify the document have in fact been received but nothing ha been done with them due to the new sale date not getting updated in the system . The modification department wo n't look at it because XXXX ha not changed the sale date to the new legal sale date given to XX/XX/XXXX . XXXX stated he will have this escalated and his supervisor XXXX will be in contact with me . I am still waiting and have heard nothing a of yet . Specialized Loan Servicing is in jeopardy of violating the federal law : Current problem that you the mortgage servicers ( SLS ) is currently perpetrating in my loan modification process . Failing to Process the Application in a Timely Manner ( Homeowners experienced lengthy delay when waiting for the servicer to make a decision on whether or not to grant a loan modification . In some case , the servicer doe n't tell the homeowner that they are missing document necessary for the loan modification decision . In others , the servicer simply doe n't get around to reviewing the request in a timely manner . ) Federal mortgage servicing rule , effective XX/XX/XXXX , aim to reduce these delay . Under these rule , when a mortgage servicer receives a loan modification application from a homeowner 45 day or more before a foreclosure sale , it must : review the application determine if the application is complete or incomplete , and notify the borrower within five day stating that the application is complete or incomplete . ( If incomplete , the servicer must describe the information needed to complete the application . ) If the servicer receives a complete application more than 37 day before a foreclosure sale , it must review the application and determine if the borrower qualifies for a loan modification within 30 day . Mortgage servicers that commit any of the violation have caused me to ( among other thing ) : incur increased fee and cost in order to avoid foreclosure lose your saving in a fruitless attempt to get a loan modification be wrongfully foreclosed upon , and/or miss out on the opportunity to pursue other alternative to foreclosure , such a a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure . As per the above SLS ha committed some of the violation mentioned above or is otherwise improperly handling my loan modification , I am being lead to believe I need to consult a qualified attorney who can advise me what should be done legally for this situation . I am in constant contact with you to have this review since XX/XX/XXXX , XX/XX/XXXX , XX/XX/XXXX , XX/XX/XXXX , XX/XX/XXXX via email and telephone . Please update my loan file and have the correct department please review the paperwork that is time stamped XX/XX/XXXX for the request for mortgage assistance/modification/workout . As of today it is 44 day before the sale date XX/XX/XXXX which mean 12 day SLS ha caused delay in this process which can be viewed a intentional .",Mortgage,Mortgage

"This complaint contains NEW information . According to the notice , First American ha scheduled a foreclosure sale for my home for XX/XX/XXXX and recorded this with the XXXX XXXX County Recorder 's Office . ( See attached file : Trustee Sale Recorded With County Recorder ) . However on XX/XX/XXXX a notice of Trustee Sale wa posted to my door with this same date . According to CA Civil Code 2924f/g , only 21 day is required for the notice to be posted . In every other instance the notice wa posted only 21 day prior to the sale . XXXX ( XXXX ) /XXXX XXXX ha violated civil code 2924f/g in the past and not published the sale date . I have personal knowledge of other people in California with XXXX XXXX loan serviced by XXXX ( XXXX ) /XXXX XXXX who have had their home foreclosed BEFORE the scheduled date . I am unable to confirm the sale date ha been published a required by CA Civil Code 2924f/g and it is very possible First American will sell the home on XX/XX/XXXX . The foreclosure is illegal debt collection and a total and complete violation of federal consumer financial law . As per the letter from First American dated XX/XX/XXXX , I disputed the debt in the third sentence of my Notice to Cease and Desist Communication dated XX/XX/XXXX . ( See attached file : Dispute The Debt ) . The letter from First American dated XX/XX/XXXX stated : `` The law requires First American to suspend it effort to collect the debt ( through litigation or otherwise ) until First American Title Insurance Company mail the requested information to you. `` ( See attached file : Trustee-First American ) . First American did not mail me anything to validate the debt a the letter stated . Instead , First American forwarded the dispute to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX . which is a debt collection agency disguised a a mortgage loan servicer and a complete and total violation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of XX/XX/XXXX . XXXX then provided documentation that did not conform with the legal standard to validate the debt . ( See attached file : Improper Debt Validation ) . When a consumer dispute a debt , the debt collector may not continue to collect the debt or contact the consumer again until the debt ha been properly validated in accordance with legal standard . In this case foreclosure is debt collection because the debt wa obtained after it wa already in default . In fact I went into default in XX/XX/XXXX and have remained in default the entire time . I have not made a mortgage payment since XX/XX/XXXX which mean the statute of limitation ha run a well . ( See attached file : XXXX CREDITOR ) . Also when the loan is sold to a new creditor , the new creditor must prove the loan wa assigned to it with documentation from the previous creditor . This is the purpose for the California Assignments of Deed of trust and they are totally fraudulent . I refinanced my mortgage with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX . The FDIC then sold XXXX to XXXX . XXXX and First American both contend XXXX XXXX is the new creditor . However the Assignments of Deed of Trust do not hold up in court a it is a well established fact XXXX never acquired any XXXX loan . This wa one of the issue involved in my dispute . ( See attached file : Dispute ) . I have now obtained the actual Assignments of Deed of Trust recorded with the XXXX XXXX County Recorder 's Office . ( See attached file : Fraudulent Assignment of Deed of Trust ) . As part of my dispute I reference a law suit agsint First American in which the court explained that in XXXX v. XXXXXXXX XXXX , XXXX , XXXX XXXX at pp . XXXX , the appeal court reversed the trial court 's decision and concluded : The recitation that XXXX XXXX XXXX is the successor in interest to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , through XXXX XXXX , is hearsay . Defendants offered no evidence to establish that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX had the beneficial interest under the XX/XX/XXXX deed of trust to assign to the Bank . The truthfulness of the content of the Assignment of Deed of Trust remains subject to dispute ( XXXX , XXXX , XXXX XXXX at p. XXXX , fn . XXXX ) , and plaintiff dispute the truthfulness of the content of all of the recorded document . ( See attached file : XXXX XXXX v First American ) . The attached California Assignments of Deed of Trust are consistent with the court decision in this case . As a result there is nothing to prove XXXX XXXX or XXXX wa assigned the Deed of Trust from the previous creditor . Notice First American wa the defendant in the case when the court referenced XXXX v. XXXX XXXX . This decision wa filed on XX/XX/XXXX so the CA Appeals court maintained this position and informed First American of it . Also enclosed is deposition testimony from another case that prof these Assignments of Deed of Trust are fraud . This is a violation of 15 U.S.C . 1692f ( 1 ) , Taking or threatening to take any non-judicial action to effect disposition or disablement of property if , e.g. , there is no present right of possession of the property claimed a collateral through an enforceable security interest is prohibited under the FDCPA . Furthermore in XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX that pp . 1094-1097 the court held that a plaintiff may properly allege a valid cause of action for wrongful foreclosure by stating fact showing the defendant who invoked the power of sale wa not the true holder of the deed of trust . The same hold true with this foreclosure . The attached CA Declaration of Compliance prof XXXX invoked the power of sale because at the bottom it say XXXX instructs the trustee to proceed with non-judicial foreclosure proceeding a the authorized agent of the beneficiary which is XXXX XXXX . However the true beneficiary are the certificate holder and neither XXXX XXXX nor XXXX are truly acting on their behalf . According to First American XXXX XXXX have invoked the power of sale . ( See attached file : Trustee-First American ) . In line 3-5 it state : `` First American Title Insurance company ha been authorized by the Servicer/Creditor to initiate foreclosure proceeding in conjunction with the foreclosure of a Deed of Trust associated with your real estate loan. `` Notice how First American state the Servicer/Creditor authorized the foreclosure . This is because First American can not determine who the true holder of the Deed of Trust is . This is because neither XXXX nor XXXX XXXX want to take responsibility for this because the truth is neither are the true holder of the Deed of Trust . In addition the letter from First American dated XX/XX/XXXX state in the first paragraph : `` The current creditor to whom the debt is owed is XXXX XXXX ... The loan is serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX `` Now Read the two attached California Assignments of Deed of Trust . As the CA Appeals court ruled in XXXX v. XXXX XXXX , even though the document recited that the bank wa assigned all beneficial interest under the deed of trust by a predecessor bank , it RECITAL that the predecessor bank wa successor to the original beneficiary wa HEARSAY , so the overall truthfulness of the assignment of the deed of trust remained subject to dispute a well . Compare the second California Assignments of Deed of Trust to the attached California Declaration of Compliance and you will see how neither XXXXXXXX XXXX nor XXXX are the true holder of the Deed of Trust . The California Declaration of Compliance say XXXX is the authorized agent for XXXXXXXX XXXX and the California Assignment of Deed of Trust assigns the Deed of Trust to XXXXXXXX XXXX CARE OF XXXX . According to this XXXX would be the authorized agent for XXXX XXXX who wa assigned the Deed of Trust CARE Of XXXX . However in the attached letter from XXXX XXXX , which admits : `` XXXXXXXX XXXX is merely the trustee for the trust that owns the mortgage and note on this property . Please note the Trust is the owner of your mortgage and note , not the trustee. `` `` The servicer is the party to the Trust that ha the authority and responsibility to make decision and take actin regarding individual mortgage in the Trust. `` ( See attached file : XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) . Compare this to the letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX enclosed in the same file . This name XXXX XXXX ON BEHALF OF THE HOLDERS OF THE XXXX MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES , SERIES XXXX a the `` owner , investor , creditor , and note holder. `` Underneath this it say : Attention : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX - XXXX Series XXXX . Underneath that it state : `` The above named entity is the owner of the account , and XXXX is the servicer of the account. `` The `` above named entity `` is NOT the true owner of the account or the true holder of the Deed of Trust . XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX consider the trust to be the entity that owns the mortgage and note . As XXXXXXXX XXXX state in paragraph two : Please note the Trust is the owner of your mortgage and note , not the trustee . This letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX is not consistent with the letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX enclosed in the same attached file . The true holder of Deed of Trust would be the certificate holder who are the investor and , collectively , the original creditor who sued XXXXXXXX XXXX in a class action law suit which wa settled ; rendering the debt satisfied . ( See attached file : Investors Class Action ) . In addition the letter from First American dated XX/XX/XXXX state in the first paragraph : `` The current creditor to whom the debt is owed is XXXX XXXX ... The loan is serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. `` ( See attached file : Trustee-First American ) . The law say the trustee may initiate a non-judicial foreclosure sale only at the direction of the person or entity that currently hold the note and the beneficial interest under the deed of trust -- the original beneficiary or it assignee -- or that entity 's agent . This is why XXXX claim to be the authorized agent for the beneficiary . However the Assignments of Deed of Trust are fraudulent and the debt is no longer valid . As a result First American ha no excuse for scheduling a foreclosure sale for my home . XXXX never had any right of possession so XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ha no present right of possession and neither doe XXXX or First American . First American ha ignored this and scheduled a foreclosure sale for my home on XX/XX/XXXX . This is a total violation of federal consumer financial law . The CFPB published an announcement that it would partner with the FTC to combat illegal debt collection . ( See attached file : CFPB and FTC Combat Illegal Debt Collection ) . Evidently neither XXXX not First American have any regard for these government agency . On XX/XX/XXXX First American stated the file wa suspended and no date ha been set for the subject property . ( See attached file : Foreclosure Suspended ) . Three month have passed without any communication from either First American or XXXX and now suddenly without providing any further documentation to validate the debt , First American ha schedule a trustee sale for XX/XX/XXXX . On XX/XX/XXXX First American mailed me a notice that wa backdated to XX/XX/XXXX and told me unless I take legal action to protect my property it may be sold at public auction and if I want an explanation to contact a lawyer . ( See attached file : Mail fraud ) . Given on XX/XX/XXXX First American already informed me the file wa suspended , it is not possible for First American to inform me on XX/XX/XXXX , my property may be sold at public auction . On XX/XX/XXXX First American also informed me it received my notice to cease and desist . ( See attached file : ( Cease and Desist ) . In addition to 15 U.S.C . 1692f ( 1 ) , First American ha also violated 807 . False or misleading representation ( 5 ) The threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken . 806 . Harassment or abuse . A debt collector may not engage in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass , oppress , or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt . 808 . Unfair practice .

"On XX/XX/2021 there wa a fraudulent charger placed on my apple card to a XXXX merchant with the name XXXX for { $ 130.00 } . I immediately disputed the charge and heard nothing back until XX/XX/XXXX when they emailed me to advise they had reinstated the charge on account of the merchant providing proof of purchase . I then engaged their chat support for 40+ minute and wa repeatedly given the wrong info so I called and spent another 30 minute requesting the proof and to reopen the dispute . That agent advised that I must prove that I did not make the charge . I asked for a manager to contact me which I wa told would happen but never did . On XXXX I called to inquire and spoke to Supervisor `` XXXX `` who stated I should have received the info so she reopened the request with `` heightened urgency `` . She also assured me I do not have to prove my innocence but that it would be good to call XXXX and file a claim with them . I called again on XXXX and spoke to supervisor `` XXXX `` explaining I need the prior digital card number ( which wa changed when filed the initial dispute ) so that I could contact XXXX to address with them . She refused to provide me the number . She then told me that the prior 3 agent had not correctly requested the proof and put me on a long hold . She eventually told me that the info wa sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX ( almost a month before I ever even asked for it ) but refused to provide the email address it wa sent from . She stated she opened another request and that her manager would call me within two hour . She advised that she had left thorough and detailed note on the account . After not receiving the promised phone call I called again on XXXX and spoke to manager `` XXXX `` who said the only note that XXXX left stated `` prior agent say they requested proof of purchase , customer state they did not receive it `` .

She state that I she again requested the proof and that it also be sent via regular mail a well . She stated that the proof wa sent to my email ( which we confirmed she had the correct address ) at XXXX Eastern time that day , she also declined to tell me what email address it came from and waited while I checked all Spam folder and inboxes ( I never got it ) She advised I should call again and ask for the `` Advocacy `` Team M-F during business hour and that she too ha updated the account and escalated the issue to the appropriate level of management . To summarize , I have formally requested the alleged proof numerous time and spent several hour on the phone trying to resolve this issue .

Neither written nor verbal permission wa granted for the reporting of my transaction , nor wa I ever informed about the distribution of my personal information to third party .

"We are a XXXX based company . On XXXX XXXX , 2020 , we made a wire transfer to our US based partner company for payment of an invoice . Their bank is Wells Fargo . The wire transfer wa sent and on XXXX XXXX , 2020 , we were advised that our partner did not receive the fund . We realized the account number wa incorrect on the wire transfer , so we immediately went to our bank , XXXX , and advised them . They immediately put a stop on the transaction even though it wa several week later . In looking at the wire transfer information , the account number did not match the payee company information . When this information doe not match , the policy of all receiving bank is to hold and return the fund to the originating bank and a new corrected wire transfer submitted . All detail on cheque , draft , money order , wire transfer , etc . must be accurate and match before a deposit can be completed . In the past , we have had payment to US based supplier and payment from US based customer held and returned due to inaccurate information on bank draft and wire transfer . This cause delay and is inconvenient but necessary and understandable to maintain the integrity of the international banking system . I contacted Wells Fargo to talk to them and wa advised that they could not speak with me because I wa not their client . I asked my partner company that wa the client , to speak with Wells Fargo , and they were advised they could not speak with them either and Wells Fargo would only speak with the originating bank ( XXXX ) . We spoke with our bank , XXXX , and they have been trying to get the money returned to our account but Wells Fargo are not co-operating . We believe the money wa deposited to the erroneous account which is against bank policy and Wells Fargo is trying to hide their negligence . The amount is { $ 79000.00 } . This is a large amount and an international transfer over { $ 10000.00 } in value . We were under the impression that all amount over { $ 10000.00 } entering the US were required to be scrutinized for fraud and to prevent money laundering . These simple bank procedure were either not performed by Wells Fargo and our money ha not been returned to XXXX for u to send a corrected wire transfer .","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"
