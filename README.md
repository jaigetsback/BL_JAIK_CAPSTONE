# Business Report on Consumer Complaint Classification Project

*Created by Jai Kumar*


## Problem Statement

In the current landscape of consumer services, efficiently managing and categorizing consumer complaints is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project aims to classify consumer complaints into predefined categories using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging the Consumer Complaint Database, the goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of complaint categorization, providing actionable insights for better consumer service.

## Results and Important Findings

### Data Exploration and Preparation

- The dataset from the Consumer Complaint Database contains approximately 6 million entries, with about 2 million (34.6%) containing relevant text data for analysis.
- Initial exploration revealed 21 product categories, which were later refined to 14 unique categories to reduce classification ambiguities caused by overlapping labels.

### Modeling Approach

- Various machine learning algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVC, Decision Tree, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model with a mean accuracy of 99.1% during cross-validation.

### Model Performance

- Upon testing with a separate dataset, the Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 83% in correctly categorizing complaints.
- The remaining 17% miss rate was primarily due to inaccurate labeling in the input dataset.

## Suggestions for Next Steps

### Enhance Data Quality

- Focus on improving the quality of data labeling to reduce errors in supervised learning processes. This can involve revisiting the labeling criteria and ensuring consistency across all entries.

### Refine Model Performance

- Continue hyperparameter tuning and explore advanced techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning models to further enhance classification accuracy.
- Implement a feedback loop where misclassified complaints are analyzed and used to retrain the model for improved accuracy.

### Scalability and Adaptation

- Given the model's success in categorizing consumer complaints, explore its application in other domains that require text classification.
- Develop scalable solutions that can handle increased data volumes without compromising performance.

### Operational Integration

- Integrate the classification model into existing customer service workflows to automate complaint handling and resolution processes.
- Train staff on interpreting model outputs to ensure seamless integration into customer service operations.

## Conclusion

The successful implementation of a Logistic Regression model for classifying consumer complaints demonstrates significant potential for improving customer service operations through machine learning. While current results are promising, focusing on data quality and model refinement will be key to achieving even greater accuracy and efficiency in complaint management. These efforts will not only enhance consumer satisfaction but also streamline operational processes across various domains.
